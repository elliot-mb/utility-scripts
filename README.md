# Utility scripts

Mainly small python scripts I've written to help me in my day-to-day life. I cannot speak to their portability, the most I can hope is they inspire someone to make something similar. 

## Usage

You must install python3 to run these scripts. These scripts may be run directly since they have the python terminal shebang. 

e.g.
```
chmod 700 retry.py
./retry.py <arguments> 
```
